# AI-powered-Installation-and-Fittings

People often make mistakes taking measurements of everyday items. How many times have you forgotten a measuring tape when going to best buy to get a new TV, only to realise it won't fit in your car?
Luckily, we all cary our phones and finding out if a product will fit in the car or on your desk should not be too much work.

 In this project, we will build a program to identify measurements of an object using computer vision and identify whether it will fit in a particular area.

 Moreover, interviewing a manufacturing company who are skiptical of online sale, compains that costumers do not know how to take measurements and in order to produce a correctly sized product, they have to send people to locations to get correct sizing. This can be made a lot easier if we could just show measurements digitally. 

 In short, we will focus on resolving thw following two scenarios in this project.

 ### Scenario 1: Will this TV fit in my car?

 ### Scenario 2: Will this window shade fit over my window?
